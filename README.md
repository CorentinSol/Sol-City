# Sol City

**Sol City** is the final projet of the third pathway of the fourth module of the [Android Basics with Compose](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-compose-my-city?continue=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.android.com%2Fcourses%2Fpathways%2Fandroid-basics-compose-unit-4-pathway-3%3Fhl%3Dfr%23codelab-https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.android.com%2Fcodelabs%2Fbasic-android-kotlin-compose-my-city#0) course.
It's build entirely with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose and tries to follow the Android [design](https://m3.material.io/) and development best pratices

# Features

Users can navigate between few tabs to discover multiple places of Sol - which is a fictional city.
The app is available in english and in french.

## Constraints

Some constraints are explicitly formulated in the subject, [Create a My City app](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-compose-my-city?continue=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.android.com%2Fcourses%2Fpathways%2Fandroid-basics-compose-unit-4-pathway-3%3Fhl%3Dfr%23codelab-https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.android.com%2Fcodelabs%2Fbasic-android-kotlin-compose-my-city#1), which are the following :
<ul>
    <li>Contain multiple screens; for example, each screen can display a different category of recommendations.</li>
    <li>Use the Jetpack Navigation component to enable users to navigate through your app.</li>
    <li>Maintain a clear distinction between the UI layer and the data layer.</li>
    <li>Use a ViewModel and make updates to the UI from the view model using the unidirectional data flow (UDF) pattern.</li>
    <li>Use adaptive layouts that account for all different screen sizes.</li>
    <li>
        Follow Material Design guidelines for <a href='https://m3.material.io/foundations/adaptive-design/overview'>adaptive design</a> and <a href='https://material.io/design/navigation/understanding-navigation.html'>navigation</a>.
    </li>
</ul>
 
# Choices Explanation

## Color Themes

Color Theme has been generated by [Material Theme Builder](https://material-foundation.github.io/material-theme-builder/). The hexadecimal value of the primary color is `#007073`.
Dynamic color option is disabled.

## Fonts

//TODO

## Navigation 

Navigation is managed by the [Navigation framework](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/navigation) to fit the constraint.
The app home page, where the user selects the city, was implemented to add a new route in the application.

# Adaptive Layouts

## Compact

### Place List Screen

The list contains card of each place. It only contains a picture of the place, it names, it category and it score because ["Cards should be easy to scan for relevant and actionable information."](https://m3.material.io/components/cards/guidelines).
Those cards use primaries theme colors because they contains central information.
Long names are truncated and what can't be shown is replaced with "..." to inform the user the name isn't fully displayed.
Full name is displayed on the place detail screen.

The default sorting of list screen is by score. The possibility to decide how to sort the list may be implemented in a next version.
The system back button has the same function as the top bar navigation arrow. It's not disabled because it offers the user the possibility to navigate
faster, even if it is redundant.

To filter list items, there is a bottom navigation bar. As suggested by [Material 3 guidelines](https://m3.material.io/components/navigation-bar/overview) 
it must contains a maximum of five choices. Each icon is from [Google Font](https://fonts.google.com/icons) - see [Images Used](https://github.com/CorentinSol/Sol-City?tab=readme-ov-file#images-used).
Some of the icon labels aren't fully shown, like "Concert Halls". This is exactly why icons are usefull.

Because `OTHER` places might be categorized, this navigation bar is not the better choice. It is used to fit navigation constraints.
A modal navigation drawer may have been more appropriated if each `OTHER` place had a precise type.

### Place Detail Screen

As in the list screen, place's score is shown with stars icons, making it ["an informative punch into a small form factor"](https://m3.material.io/styles/icons/designing-icons).
First approach there was to display the number of stars corresponding to the score. But even if we might think it's obviously a mark out of five, it might not be.
The solution was to display five stars on a `primary container color`, which are filled with the `onPrimary container color`, depending on the score value.

The place description is very long to practice scrollable items. For a real world implementation, it would have been limited.

Contact information are at the end of the page because in a real-world implementation, it would have fit on the page, making it easy to find.
Actually, the contact icon is an envelope no matter the type of contact it is, but it should depend on the media. This card should be clickable to open
the appropriate application. Both of these elements will be implemented later.

## Medium


//TODO

## Extended
Navigation component used here is a [navigation rail](https://m3.material.io/components/navigation-rail), and both the list of places and the detail pane are displayed 
at the same time. This way, all space available is used to optimize the user experience.

To inform the user which place he selected, the corresponding card is set to the `primaryContainer` color.
Also, the selected place's name is displayed on top of the detail part of the screen.
It prevents long names being cut in the list view.

The part of the screen displaying all details about a place has a different background color - `inversePrimary` -
and a rounded corner shape reminding a card, to help the user distinguish
each part of the screen.

# Comment about places information

None of the place used in this application is meant to be an existing one, and every contact information (phonenumbers, emails and @) are fictive.
Let me know if any of these information causes any problem, to change them.
