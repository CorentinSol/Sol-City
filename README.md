## Constraints

Some constraints are explicitly formulated in the subject, [Create a My City app](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-compose-my-city?continue=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.android.com%2Fcourses%2Fpathways%2Fandroid-basics-compose-unit-4-pathway-3%3Fhl%3Dfr%23codelab-https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.android.com%2Fcodelabs%2Fbasic-android-kotlin-compose-my-city#1), which are the following :
<ul>
    <li>Contain multiple screens; for example, each screen can display a different category of recommendations.</li>
    <li>Use the Jetpack Navigation component to enable users to navigate through your app.</li>
    <li>Maintain a clear distinction between the UI layer and the data layer.</li>
    <li>Use a ViewModel and make updates to the UI from the view model using the unidirectional data flow (UDF) pattern.</li>
    <li>Use adaptive layouts that account for all different screen sizes.</li>
    <li>
        Follow Material Design guidelines for <a href='https://m3.material.io/foundations/adaptive-design/overview'>adaptive design</a> and <a href='https://material.io/design/navigation/understanding-navigation.html'>navigation</a>.

# Choices Explanation

## Color Themes

Color Theme has been generated by [Material Theme Builder](https://material-foundation.github.io/material-theme-builder/). The hexadecimal value of the primary color is `#007073`.
I allowed the dynamic color option to let the user decide to use it or not.

## Fonts

//TODO

## Navigation 

//TODO => Using the Jetpack Navigation component (where ?)
//TODO "Select your city" as home screen => even if just one, to add screens to Navigation

# Adaptive Layouts

## Compact

### City Home Screen

// TODO : Default Order by what ? Why ? Back button (return select city) ?
Drawer or Rail and why not button?
FILTER/ORDER BY button ?
Card of pic, name, type and score Because ["Cards should be easy to scan for relevant and actionable information."](https://m3.material.io/components/cards/guidelines).
//TODO

### Place Details Screen

The score is shown with stars icons, making it ["an informative punch into a small form factor"](https://m3.material.io/styles/icons/designing-icons).
It makes the score easier to read. First there was the number of stars corresponding to the score, but even if we might think it's obviously a mark out of five, it might not be.
The solution was to display five stars on a `secondary container color`, which are filled with the `on secondary container color`, depending on the score value.

The contact logo is actually an email no matter the type of contact it is, but it should depend on the media. It will be implemented later.

None of the place used in this application is meant to be an existing one, and every contact informations (phonenumbers, emails and @) are fictive. Let me know if any of these informations causes any problem to change them.
